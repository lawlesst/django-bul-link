django-link360
================

A basic interface to the Serial Solutions 360 Link API.  This is intended to 
provide an example of how to use the API and to get a Django App that uses it
up and running quickly.  You will probably want to subclass these views in a
separate app to meet your needs. 

* Setup a Django project or use an existing project
* Install django-link360 using pip
* Add the django-link360 views to your projects urls.py
* Add your Serial Solutions API key to settings.py as
** LINK360_SERSOL_KEY = 'key'
* Start the Django development server
* Begin testing
